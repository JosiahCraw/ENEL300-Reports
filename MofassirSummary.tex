In this guest lecture we covered secure software, vulnerabilities, exploitation, and tools that 
are used within the industry. First, Mofassir discussed what a vulnerability is, they are usually
a design flaw, an implementation bug or an improper implementation. Some examples of these are,
the design of the internet, as a design flaw as it was designed before hacking of internet
vulnerabilities was considered. This is an issue now as the internet has expanded and
vulnerabilities are a key design consideration. The next example covered a implementation bug,
this is when a programmer has a code based flaw that could be exploited. The final example is an
improper configuration, this is when the software is designed well and there are few to no
exploitable flaws however, the end user has set the software up poorly like leaving the password
as the default.\\

Mofassir then covered exploitations, these are when a person of party find a vulnerability and
exploit it some examples are given.

\begin{itemize}
    
    \item{Loss of sensitive information}

        \begin{itemize}
            
            \item{Capital One Bank lost more than 100 million records}

            \item{The European GDPR allows a fine for a loss equal to either 10 million Euro or
                4\% of a companies annual turnover}
                \begin{itemize}
                    
                    \item{British Airways lost 500,000 records 200 million Euro fine}
                        
                    \item{Marriot Hotel lost 3 million records and received a 110 million euro
                        fine}

                \end{itemize}
        
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item{DDoS GitHub had 1.35 Terabits per second of traffic through a DDoS attack in the 1st
            quarter of 2019}

        \item{Firewalls, Anti-Virus, IDS, IPS are not particularly effective}

\end{itemize}

The next component of the lecture was on the tools used by hackers and professionals as well as
governments to access different software. Mofassir told us these can be broken down into three
categories:

\begin{itemize}
    
    \item{Free tools}

    \item{Paid tools}

    \item{Custom tools, these are mostly used by governments}

\end{itemize}
