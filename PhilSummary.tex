\maketitle{}
For the lecture with Professor Bones the design of everyday things was discussed. The main points
discussed were the following:

\begin{itemize}
    \item{Affordances}
    \item{Signifiers}
    \item{Mappings}
    \item{Feedback}
    \item{Conceptual Models}
    \item{Constraints}
    \item{Conventions}
\end{itemize}

These principals make up the core components of design. The first is affordances, this is visually
what the design allows for i.e. a chair affords sitting. The second is siginfiers, these include
obvious symbolism such as arrow icons on an application signifying that there are more pages.
Another example of siginfiers is a simple sign such as a traffic sign show what lane is for what
turn off
