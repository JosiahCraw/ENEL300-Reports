The main points that Shayne covered was the ideas of design and development and how real world
design progresses and the issues that can come designing for the real world. He started with a quote
"Power of failure in success". He told us that Through failure we all learn and thats how we improve
at what we are doing. He gave us a figure, 63\% of new products fail. This he said showed the
complexity in successful design. Shayne then listed some real life failed business/engineering
ideas.

\begin{itemize}
    \item{BIC attempted to make disposable underwear}
    \item{Harley Davidson attempted a fragrance}
    \item{Google attempted a social networking platform, Google Plus}
    \item{Colgate attempted frozen dinners}
\end{itemize}

All of products failed either very quickly or had to be killed off slowly after never becoming
profitable. Shayne then talked about time pressure in the real world and how as engineering students
we are put though pressure to ensure our abilities in the workforce. Shayne then went through the
main reasons for failure.

\begin{enumerate}
    
    \item{Lack of Market research}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item{Poor market assessment and validation}
            \item{Poor quality market research}
        \end{itemize}

    \item{Technical Issues}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item{No/poor preliminary technology assessments}
        \end{itemize}

    \item{Timing to market}

    \item{Insufficient sales and market effort}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item{Management thinks it will sell itself}
            \item{Usually takes 7-10 times the cost of development just to get to market}
        \end{itemize}

    \item{Political Upheaval}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item{Change of management}
            \item{May have the correct product, management decides it is not ready}
        \end{itemize}

    \item{Financial}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item{Budget}
            \item{Risk}
